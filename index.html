            <p>A balanced and healthy diet consists of several ingredients. It included enough pulses, grains, proteins
                in the form of meat and eggs or plant protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats. Healthy fats come in the
                form of almonds and cashews.</p>

            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Hey, this is my homepage, so I have to say something about myself. Sometimes it is hard to introduce
                yourself because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with. Let me give a try
                to see what kind of image you have about me through my self-description. I hope that my impression about
                myself and your impression about me are not so different. Here it goes.
